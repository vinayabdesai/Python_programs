#Welcome to Vinaya programs
This is first Git program
I have done couple to git operations like basic git add, git commit -m "comments", git push
Additional commands - git status, git log, git config -l, 
Also created ssh keys - i.e generating ssh private key and moving it to specific folder and using that key while git push
